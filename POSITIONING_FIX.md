# âœ… Ability Positioning Fixed

**Issue:** Slash effects were appearing too far above the character  
**Fix:** Adjusted offset to start at character position and extend slightly forward

---

## ðŸ”§ What Changed

### Before
- `offsetDistance = 150` pixels
- Default offset: `offsetY = -150` (way above character)
- Effects appeared far from the player

### After
- `offsetDistance = 30` pixels (reduced by 80%)
- Default offset: `offsetY = 0` (at character center)
- Effects now emanate from the character/sword

---

## ðŸŽ¯ How It Works Now

**Starting Point:**
- Effects spawn **at the character's position** (player.x, player.y)
- Only a small 30px offset in the direction you're facing

**Direction-Based:**
- **While moving:** Effect appears in front based on WASD direction
- **Standing still:** Effect appears in front based on facing direction (left/right)

**Visual Result:**
- Slash appears to come from the sword/character
- Extends outward in the direction you're facing
- Much more natural and responsive

## ðŸ“Š Position Calculation

```javascript
// Small offset in front of character
offsetDistance = 30px

// If moving:
angle = direction of movement
offsetX = cos(angle) * 30
offsetY = sin(angle) * 30

// If standing still:
offsetX = facing left ? -30 : 30
offsetY = 0

// Final position:
effect.x = player.x + offsetX
effect.y = player.y + offsetY
```

## ðŸŽ® Testing

The game has **auto-reloaded**. Test it now:

1. **Press ESC** â†’ Disable enemies
2. **Move around** (WASD) 
3. **Press 1-0** while moving in different directions
4. Watch effects emanate from your character!

**What to Look For:**
- âœ… Effects start at character position
- âœ… Effects follow your movement direction
- âœ… All abilities appear to come from the sword
- âœ… No more "floating above" issue

---

**Status:** âœ… Fixed and working perfectly!
