## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Direction-Based System

All abilities now use consistent facing angle:
```javascript
// Calculate facing direction
facingAngle = Math.atan2(velocity.y, velocity.x);

// Apply custom offset per ability
offsetX = Math.cos(facingAngle) * customDistance;
offsetY = Math.sin(facingAngle) * customDistance;
```

### Chain Explosion (Ability 10)

```javascript
// Create 5 hits in a line
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  delay = i * 150ms;
  position = basePosition + (i * 100px in facing direction);
  spawn slash at position;
}
```

**Result:** Visual wave of explosions traveling outward!
