## 📝 Development Notes for Continuation

### Code Organization
- **Modular ES6 classes** for all entities
- **Scene-based architecture** (Boot → Game)
- **Utility-based helpers** (CollisionMap, FloatingText, UIBars)
- **Event-driven** animation and combat systems

### Adding New Features
To add a new enemy type:
1. Add sprite sheet to `public/assets/`
2. Load in `BootScene.js`
3. Create animations in `Enemy.js` constructor
4. Add type logic in `Enemy.js` stat assignment
5. Spawn in `GameScene.js` `startWave()` method

To add a new character:
1. Create new class in `entities/` (extend Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Sprite)
2. Define animations, stats, and abilities
3. Add to `GameScene.js` character switching menu
4. Update camera follow logic
5. Add button to ESC menu

### Performance Considerations
- Collision detection optimized (center-point only)
- Sprite pooling for projectiles recommended for >50 enemies
- DOM UI updates are minimal (2 elements)
- Depth sorting only for visible buildings/decorations
