# Implementation Summary - Medieval Warriors Game

## ✅ Completed Tasks

### 1. Project Setup ✓
- Created game directory structure
- Configured package.json with Phaser 3.87.0 and Vite 5.0
- Set up vite.config.js for optimized asset handling
- Created index.html with game container

### 2. Asset Management ✓
- Copied all required assets to `game/public/assets/`:
  - map-2.png (level background)
  - Black Warrior sprites (all 5 animations)
  - Red Warrior sprites (enemy)
  - Red Archer sprites (enemy)
  - Shadow overlay

### 3. Core Systems ✓

#### BootScene (Asset Loading)
- Implemented loading screen with progress bar
- Loaded all sprite sheets with correct frame dimensions (192x192)
- Configured all player and enemy animations

#### CollisionMap Utility
- Pixel-perfect terrain detection system
- Analyzes map image to identify walkable (green island) vs non-walkable (water) areas
- RGB color range detection: R:120-170, G:160-210, B:90-150 for green terrain
- Area-based collision checking for sprite bounding boxes

#### Player Entity (Black Warrior)
- **5 Animations**:
  - Idle: 8 frames @ 6 FPS
  - Run: 6 frames @ 10 FPS
  - Attack1: 4 frames @ 12 FPS
  - Attack2: 4 frames @ 10 FPS
  - Guard: 6 frames @ 6 FPS

- **Controls**:
  - WASD: 8-directional movement (200 px/s)
  - SPACE: Attack (alternates between attack1/attack2)
  - SHIFT: Guard/block (50% damage reduction)

- **Combat System**:
  - Hitbox creation during attack frames 2-3
  - 40px reach in facing direction
  - Attack damage: 15 (attack1), 25 (attack2)
  - 500ms attack cooldown
  - Knockback on hit

- **Movement**:
  - Terrain collision checking before movement
  - Stops at water boundaries
  - Diagonal movement normalization
  - Flip sprite based on facing direction

#### Enemy Entity (Red Units)
- **Two Types**:
  - **Red Warrior**: Melee, 100 HP, patrol/chase/attack AI
  - **Red Archer**: Ranged, 60 HP, stationary shooter

- **AI States**:
  - **Patrol**: Warriors move between waypoints
  - **Chase**: Triggered within 300px (warrior) / 450px (archer)
  - **Attack**: Within 60px (melee) / 400px (ranged)

- **Combat**:
  - Warrior: 10 damage melee, 1s cooldown
  - Archer: 8 damage arrows, 2s cooldown, 300 px/s projectile speed
  - Health bars above enemies
  - Damage feedback (red tint)
  - Knockback on hit

#### GameScene (Main Gameplay)
- **Map Setup**: 
  - Background image at (0,0)
  - World bounds set to map dimensions
  - Collision map generated from image

- **Player Spawn**: 
  - Position: (350, 300) - green island top-left
  - Confined to island terrain

- **Enemy Spawning**:
  - 3 Red Warriors at different patrol positions
  - 2 Red Archers at strategic locations

- **Camera**:
  - Smooth follow with 0.1 lerp
  - 1.5x zoom for detailed view
  - Bounded to map dimensions

- **UI Elements**:
  - Controls display (top-left)
  - Player health indicator
  - Game Over / Victory screens
  - Restart functionality (R key)

### 4. Main Game Initialization ✓
- Configured Phaser game instance
- 1024x768 resolution
- Arcade physics (top-down, no gravity)
- Pixel-perfect rendering enabled
- Scene management (Boot → Game)

## 🎮 Game Flow

1. **Boot Scene**: Load all assets with progress indicator
2. **Game Scene**: 
   - Generate collision map
   - Spawn player at island spawn point
   - Create 5 enemies (3 warriors, 2 archers)
   - Start gameplay loop
3. **Gameplay**:
   - Player moves with WASD, confined to island
   - Enemies patrol/chase/attack based on AI
   - Combat system with attacks, blocking, knockback
   - Health management for player and enemies
4. **End Conditions**:
   - **Victory**: All enemies defeated
   - **Game Over**: Player health reaches 0
   - **Restart**: Press R to restart
