## 🎯 Technical Implementation

### New System Features

**1. Direction-Based Positioning**
```javascript
// Effects spawn in front of player based on movement direction
const angle = Math.atan2(velocity.y, velocity.x);
offsetX = Math.cos(angle) * 150;
offsetY = Math.sin(angle) * 150;
```

**2. Individual Ability Handling**
Each ability has custom parameters:
- **Scale:** Size of the effect (0.3 to 1.5)
- **Rotation:** Angle in degrees (0° to 90°)
- **Speed Multiplier:** Animation speed (0.2x to 2.0x)
- **Flip:** Mirror horizontally (-1 = flipped)

**3. Multi-Hit Abilities**
- Ability 4: 3 slashes with 150ms delay
- Ability 7: 3 slashes with 100ms delay + rotation

**4. Dynamic Animation Speed**
```javascript
// Creates temporary animations with adjusted frame rates
frameRate: baseFrameRate * speedMultiplier
```

## 🔧 Code Changes

**File Modified:** `game/src/systems/AbilitySystem.js`

**Lines Changed:** ~115 lines (complete rewrite of visual system)

---

## 💡 Customization Tips

### To Adjust an Ability

Find the ability in `AbilitySystem.js` line ~254:

```javascript
case 'ability1': // Quick Slash
  this.createSlashSprite(ability, offsetX, offsetY, 
    1.5,  // Scale (size)
    0,    // Rotation (degrees)
    1.0,  // Speed multiplier
    1     // Flip X (-1 to mirror)
  );
  break;
```

**Parameters:**
1. `offsetX, offsetY` - Position offset from player
2. `scale` - Size multiplier (0.3 = small, 1.5 = large)
3. `rotation` - Degrees clockwise (0-360)
4. `speedMultiplier` - Animation speed (0.2 = slow, 2.0 = fast)
5. `flipX` - Horizontal mirror (1 = normal, -1 = flipped)

## 🎨 Visual Effect Examples

### Multi-Hit Abilities
**Ability 4 (Spinning Slash):**
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  this.scene.time.delayedCall(i * 150, () => {
    this.createSlashSprite(ability, offsetX, offsetY, 0.3, 0, 2.0, 1);
  });
}
```
- Creates 3 slashes
- 150ms delay between each
- 2x speed per slash

**Ability 7 (Quick Jab):**
```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  this.scene.time.delayedCall(i * 100, () => {
    this.createSlashSprite(ability, offsetX, offsetY, 0.3, i * 45, 1.0, 1);
  });
}
```
- Creates 3 slashes
- 100ms delay between each
- Each rotated 45° more (0°, 45°, 90°)

## ✅ Testing Checklist
