## üö¶ Risk Management

### Potential Blockers

**1. Ally AI Complexity** üü°
- **Risk:** Allies behave erratically or get stuck
- **Mitigation:** Start simple, test frequently, limit ally count
- **Fallback:** Simpler AI (just follow + basic attack)

**2. Performance Issues** üü°
- **Risk:** FPS drops with many entities
- **Mitigation:** Profile early, optimize collision
- **Fallback:** Cap ally count at 4

**3. Scope Creep** üü°
- **Risk:** Adding features beyond MVP
- **Mitigation:** Stick to TARGET_SPEC, defer nice-to-haves
- **Fallback:** Cut abilities to 2 instead of 4

## üìù Development Workflow

### Starting Each Session
1. Read `CURRENT_STATE.md` to understand what's done
2. Check `ROADMAP.md` for current phase tasks
3. Run `git log` to see recent changes
4. Start dev server: `cd game && npm run dev`

### Ending Each Session
1. Commit work with descriptive message
2. Update `CURRENT_STATE.md` if phase complete
3. Update `ROADMAP.md` progress tracker
4. Note any blockers or decisions needed

---

**Next Action:** Begin Phase 2 - Create AllyCharacter.js

See `CURRENT_STATE.md` for exact codebase state.  
See `TARGET_SPEC.md` for end goals.
