# 🎯 Phase 4 Enhancements - Session Summary

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete  
**Session Duration:** ~1 hour

---

## 🚀 What Was Enhanced

This session added significant improvements to the Phase 4 ability system, focusing on direction-based combat and monk functionality.

---

## ✅ Enhancement 1: Direction-Based Slash Rotation

### Problem
- All slash effects spawned at correct positions but always faced the same direction
- Didn't visually match which way the player was facing
- Felt disconnected from player input

### Solution
- Added `lastFacingAngle` property to Player class
- Tracks player's facing direction in radians
- Updates automatically when player moves
- Persists when player stops (remembers last direction)

### Implementation
```javascript
// Player.js
this.lastFacingAngle = 0; // Track last facing direction

// Update when moving
if (velocityX !== 0 || velocityY !== 0) {
  this.lastFacingAngle = Math.atan2(velocityY, velocityX);
}

// AbilitySystem.js
const facingAngle = this.player.lastFacingAngle || 0;
const facingDegrees = Phaser.Math.RadToDeg(facingAngle);

// Apply to slash sprite
slashSprite.setAngle(facingDegrees + baseRotation);
```

### Result
- ✅ All 10 abilities now rotate to match facing direction
- ✅ Works even when standing still
- ✅ Visually cohesive combat feedback
- ✅ Each ability's base rotation adds to facing direction

---

## ✅ Enhancement 2: Monk Combat System

### Problem
- Monks only healed, didn't engage in combat
- Animation stuck in running state
- Used wrong target variable (`currentTarget` vs `target`)
- AI state machine issues

### Solution

#### 2.1: Added Attack Capability
- Monks now attack with slash2-effect (Diagonal Strike)
- Attack damage: 15
- Attack range: 120px
- Slash effect matches ability 2 (diagonal, rotated -90°, double speed)

#### 2.2: Fixed AI State Machine
```javascript
updateAI() {
  // Priority: Healing > Attacking
  const leaderNeedsHealing = this.leader && !this.leader.isDead && 
                             (this.leader.health / this.leader.maxHealth) < 1.0;
  
  if (leaderNeedsHealing && this.attackCooldown <= 0) {
    this.aiState = 'follow';
    this.checkForHealing();
    return; // Exit early, don't do anything else
  }
  
  // Standard behavior when not healing
  if (this.aiState === 'follow') {
    this.followLeader();
    this.checkForEnemies();
  } else if (this.aiState === 'engage' && this.target) {
    this.engageTarget();
  }
}
```

#### 2.3: Fixed Target Variable
- Changed all `this.currentTarget` → `this.target` (4 occurrences)
- Now uses correct variable from AllyCharacter base class

#### 2.4: Direction-Based Slash
- Monk slash rotates to face target enemy
- Uses same rotation system as player abilities

### Result
- ✅ Monks heal player when wounded (priority)
- ✅ Monks attack enemies when player at full health
- ✅ Proper animation states (idle → run → attack → idle)
- ✅ No more stuck animations
- ✅ Slash effects rotate to face targets

---

## ✅ Enhancement 3: Ability 8 (Circular Slash)

### Change
- **Before:** Single hit at 60px offset
- **After:** 5-hit chain explosion (like ability 10)

### Implementation
```javascript
case 'ability8':
  const chainDistance8 = 100;
  for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    this.scene.time.delayedCall(i * 150, () => {
      const chainOffsetX8 = Math.cos(facingAngle) * (baseOffsetDistance + (i * chainDistance8));
      const chainOffsetY8 = Math.sin(facingAngle) * (baseOffsetDistance + (i * chainDistance8));
      this.createSlashSprite(ability, chainOffsetX8, chainOffsetY8, 0.6, facingDegrees, 1.0, 1);
    });
  }
  break;
```

### Result
- ✅ 5 slashes spawn in a line (100px apart)
- ✅ 150ms delay between each
- ✅ Scale 0.6 (larger for visibility)
- ✅ Rotates with facing direction

---

## ✅ Enhancement 4: Ability 9 (Wave Slash)

### Change
- **Before:** Single hit at 60px offset
- **After:** 3 quick hits at same position (like ability 4)

### Implementation
```javascript
case 'ability9':
  const offset9 = 70; // Same as ability 4
  const baseX9 = Math.cos(facingAngle) * offset9;
  const baseY9 = Math.sin(facingAngle) * offset9;
  for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
    this.scene.time.delayedCall(i * 100, () => {
      this.createSlashSprite(ability, baseX9, baseY9, 0.3, facingDegrees, 1.0, 1);
    });
  }
  break;
```

### Result
- ✅ 3 slashes at same position (70px in front)
- ✅ 100ms delay (rapid succession)
- ✅ Consistent with other multi-hit abilities
- ✅ Rotates with facing direction
