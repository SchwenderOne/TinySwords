## 💡 Design Notes

### All Abilities Unlocked for Testing
For testing purposes, **all 10 abilities are unlocked from the start**. This allows you to:
1. Test every slash effect immediately
2. Compare visual styles
3. Decide which abilities to use in final game
4. Adjust cooldowns/damage based on feel

### Ability Selection Recommendation
Once you've tested all effects, consider:
- **Keep 4-6 abilities** for clarity (not overwhelming)
- **Mix fast/slow cooldowns** for interesting choices
- **Balance single-target vs AOE** for tactical depth
- **Reserve slot 0 for ultimate** (20s cooldown feels special)
